Hello and welcome to a small project I wanted to work on for the sake of learning some new things, and also to maybe contribute a small bit to the Hollow Knight and Hollow Knight: Silksong Community.

I wanted to make a small Debug Mod for Hollow Knight: Silksong with the hopes of learning how some of the things in a debugmod work as I work on it.

For now, my goals are to get hitbox overlays for collision, enemies, hornet, and hazards.  
A simple but nice looking display in the top right corner of the screen for hornets position.  
and maybe some form of solution to save-state saving and loading would be a pretty cool thing to figure out.  
maybe a noclip feature of some kind to make getting to positions easier for testing purposes.

I know and understand there are many mods in the works that likely already accomplish these goals, so this is here for anyone that wants one that is maybe slightly smaller, or simpler.

With all that out of the way, here is the current state of the project:  
-A simple display in the top right with a dynamically sized vertical box based on the elements contained within.  
Elements within currently are:  
-Hornet's Position in the current scene X and Y values rounded to the second decimal place.  
-The currently loaded scene's name.
